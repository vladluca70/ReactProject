## 🧠 Why React?

I started this project to deepen my understanding of React, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. My goal was to practice React fundamentals by creating practical, small applications.

## 📚 What I've Built

The portfolio includes the following projects:
- **Color Picker** — Select and preview colors dynamically.
- **BMI Calculator** — Calculate Body Mass Index with user inputs.
- **To Do List** — Manage daily tasks with add and remove functionality.
- **Shopping List** — Keep track of items to buy with a simple interface.
- **Counter** — A simple counter app demonstrating state changes.
- **Notes** — A notes app that saves user input persistently.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **React** — For building UI components and managing state. I used hooks like `useState()` and `useEffect()` to handle state and side effects. I also leveraged `localStorage` to persist data across sessions, especially in projects like Notes and To Do List.
- **React Router** — For navigation between project pages using `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, and `<Link>`.
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS** — Core web technologies for structure, styling, and logic.
- **Vite** — A fast and modern build tool for React development.

## 📁 Project Structure

The codebase is organized into separate folders for each project and related assets, ensuring clean separation and easy navigation.

## 🌟 Final Thoughts

This collection represents an important step in my learning path, helping me grow from basic JavaScript and HTML/CSS towards mastering React's component-driven architecture, hooks like `useEffect()`, and routing features.
